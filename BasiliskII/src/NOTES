commands run in Unix dir

```
cd src/Unix
```

## make for browser

```
# (once, otherwise configure will say c compiler is broken)
source path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh
# eg. source ~/code/tools/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh

# first, make sure you've already built for native once, as this produces generated CPU source files
./_emboostrap.sh

# _emconfigure.sh runs the configure script with configure flags.
./_emconfigure.sh

# now actually build it
# use 'mostlyclean' because 'clean' will delete the generated CPU files
# `make mostlyclean` is required when switching between native and web builds, to remove the native .o files
make mostlyclean && make
```

This will produce `BasiliskII` (JS bootstrap) and `BasiliskII.wasm` files.

## how the build system was modified for emscripten

changes have been made to the input files to autoconf (BasiliskII/src/Unix/configure.ac and BasiliskII/src/Unix/Makefile.in)
certain options which might be automatically enabled based on detected functionality in the host environment, which doesn't exist in the target (web), have been hard coded (eg. disabling ethernet, assembly optimizations etc)

as the basilisk build system compiles a c++ binary which then generates more code, we first need to build for native to generate this code, then build again for web, deleting compiled object files but not the generated CPU code. the 'mostlyclean' make rule deletes only the correct files.
